    "While the Python language is an excellent tool for general-purpose programming, with a highly readable syntax, rich and powerful data types (strings, lists, sets, dictionaries, arbitrary length integers, etc) and a very comprehensive standard library, it was not designed specifically for mathematical and scientific computing.  Neither the language nor its standard library have facilities for the efficient representation of multidimensional datasets, tools for linear algebra and general matrix manipulations (an essential building block of virtually all technical computing), nor any data visualization facilities.\n",

In contrast, much of our modern heritage of scientific computing has been built on top of libraries written in the Fortran language, which has native support for vectors and matrices as well as a library of mathematical functions that can efficiently operate on entire arrays at once."

    "### The broadcasting rules\n",
    "\n",
    "This broadcasting behavior is powerful, especially because when numpy broadcasts to create new dimensions or to 'stretch' existing ones, it doesn't replicate the data.  In the example above the operation is carried *as if* the 3 was a 1-d array with 3 in all of its entries, but no actual array was ever created.  This can save memory in cases when the arrays in question are large, with significant performance implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general rule is: when operating on two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise. It starts with the trailing dimensions, and works its way forward, creating dimensions of length 1 as needed. Two dimensions are considered compatible when\n",
    "\n",
    "* they are equal or either is None or one\n",
    "* either dimension is 1 or ``None``, or if dimensions are equal\n",
    "\n",
    "If these conditions are not met, a `ValueError: frames are not aligned` exception is thrown, indicating that the arrays have incompatible shapes. The size of the resulting array is the maximum size along each dimension of the input arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples below:\n",

    "(9, 5)   (9, 5)   (9, 5)   (9, 1)\n",
