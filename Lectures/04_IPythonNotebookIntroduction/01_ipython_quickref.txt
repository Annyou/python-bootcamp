====================
IPython: What is it?
====================
- python shell on steroids
- can do everything you can do in plain python shell
- In[] and Out[] objects to help you manage intermediate inputs and results
- shell integration (call arbitrary commands)
- Introspection (easier docstring lookup)
- Tab completion
- non-blocking plotting (show an example of pylab mode at work)
- cross-session command line history (up-arrow doesn't work in plain python)
- %run 01_somefile.py   (demo - next slide)
- interactive debugging (demo - next slide)
